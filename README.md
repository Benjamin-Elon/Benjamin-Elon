##### Hi there.

#### Here is some information about me:

My name is Benny.

I program using Python and Sqlite, and perform data anaysis in both R and Python. Additionally, have directly managed website content using HTML and CSS.

I am a self-motivated student learning from home, although, I try not to learn home because it's healthy to get out of the house.

My primary interest is in machine learning, but I have developed a recent love for mathematics. It's a beautiful language, and whenever I grok a new topic, it is like unlocking new abilities. I can't wait to advance my learning until I am able to work on the projects of my dreams.

While learning and taking courses, I am working on several projects of my own invention and currently building some useful tools.

I'm always welcome to feedback, and I value poeples' input. When criticized, I look for the good in what is being said, and I always assume benevolence until shown otherwise. Trust is a function of this assumption, and it accumulates over time. I define trust as confidence in what a persons' behavior will be. It can be negative or positive, and usually a mix of the two - individual people are made of many behavioral characteristics. The 'desire to do Good', and actually 'doing Good', are the not same thing. The vast majority of people desire to do good (Exception: Those who conciously choose to be an antagonist). While it isn't pleasant to be spoken to sharply, a negative interaction can be transformed into a positive or neutral outcome. I like learning more than I enjoy being right.

I look forward to collaboration and producing some wonderful creations!

##### How you can help collaborate:

-I have a lot to learn, and I guarantee my code has noob moments. If you are reading my code and know a better way to implement something, leave a comment with an explanation of what to change. I'd appreciate it because you don't know what you don't know. -If you know of a project that would appreciate help, hit me up.

I am also on this other site:

###### and I am also one-hundred percent hirable. So hire me ya mofos! Or for some slave-type internship-thing. It's not all about the money; an experience has it's fair share of value.

Zero five two - seven five four - four eight three zeero.

peace
