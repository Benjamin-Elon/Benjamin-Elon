### Hi there.

Here is some information about me:

I am a self-motivated student learning from home. I try not to learn at my home because it's healthy to get out, and I have other better places to be. 

I program using Python and Sqlite, and perform data anaysis in both R and Python. I occasionally fiddle with Assembly, but have only done this for the purpose of 'modifying' gameplay in MMO's. Additionally, have directly managed website content using HTML and CSS.

My primary interest is in machine learning. I have a newfound love for mathematics, and I am finding multi-fractal mathematics particularly fascinating. I can't wait to advance my abiities until I am able to work on the projects of my dreams. Until that time, I am building tools which are useful in my day-to-day life.

I am working on several projects of my own invention - now using github version control. Lost an entire project. Learned my lesson. And here I am.

I am also on this other useful site:

I look forward to collaboration and producing some wonderful creations.


#### I am also one-hundred percent hirable. So hire me ya mofos!
