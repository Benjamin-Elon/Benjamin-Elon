##### Hi there.

### Here is some information about me:

Benjamin Elon from Atlanta, Georgia. Permanently residing in Israel, since 2011.

I was initially interested in statistics and machine learning. As time progressed, I began to expand by my knowledge of methodologies to interpret information. The field is vast.

### Language Skills
**Python** and **Sqlite** for web scraping, machine learning, data management
**Pandas** and **Seaborn** for data analysis
**HTML** and **CSS** for managing website content

**I am working on two projects of my own invention.

**The first project is a tool for visualizing the Israeli rental market.** Currently available information on the rental market is at best, vague - usually nonexistent. The project goal is to provide access to a greater understanding of the rental market. While not yet a fully featured program, users are able to generate visuals for any region of the country using more than 30 normal and composite parameters. Upcoming versions will include geoplotting as well. 

Here are a few simple examples.

**The second project is a world-wide news tracker. It streamlines the process searching for and reading foreign-language news sources.** Users are able to create personalized news feeds using simple and complex search queries. I have included several features ensuring users can easily find what they are looking for. Ordinarily quite difficult to achieve without assistance from a native speaker. I call it One World News.

While developing these unique projects my skillset blossomed:
    1. Relational SQL
    2. Headless browser automation
    3. Curl requests (a lesser known, often superior approach to scraping)
    4. Built myself a cookie spoofer to get past Amazon captchas 
    5. Pandas
    6. Seaborn/Joypy (matplotlib), plotting, facegrids, subplots
    7. Countless built-in functions (zip, enumerate, map, etc.)
    8. Experienced the imperative of good coding practices and style
    9. Learned to deal with date-times
    10. The importance of Version Control.
    11. Optimizaton priorities
    12. So much more.

**How you can help:**
-I will always have a lot to learn. If you find the idea of these projects interesting and would like to contribute, Give me a call.
