### Hi there.

Here is some information about me:

My name is Benny.

I program using Python and Sqlite, and perform data anaysis in both R and Python. I occasionally fiddle with Assembly, but have only done this for the purpose of 'modifying' gameplay in MMO's. Additionally, have directly managed website content using HTML and CSS.

I am a self-motivated student learning from home, although, I try not to learn home because it's healthy to get out of the house.

My primary interest is in machine learning. I can't wait to advance my abiities until I am able to work on the projects of my dreams.

While learning and taking courses, I am working on several projects of my own inventionc and currently building some useful tools.

I am also on this other useful site:

I look forward to collaboration and producing some wonderful creations.


#### I am also one-hundred percent hirable. So hire me ya mofos!
