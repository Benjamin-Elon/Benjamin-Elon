##### Hi there.

#### Here is some information about me:

Benjamin Elon from Atlanta, Georgia. Permanently residing in Israel, since 2011.

I was initially interested in statistics and machine learning. As time progressed, I began to expand by my knowledge of methodologies to interpret information.

#### Language Skills
**Python** and **Sqlite** for web scraping, machine learning, data management
**Pandas** and **Seaborn** for data analysis
**HTML** and **CSS** for managing website content

#### Projects that demonstrate my skills
I am working on two projects of my own invention.

**The first project is a tool for visualizing the Israeli rental market.** Existing data and charts are...vague and sad. I want the public to be able to understand the layout of the rental market for any region of the country by real estate metrics such as median and range of price per neighborhood, average arnona (real estate tax), …. These plots showing ….. are one example.

**The second project allows a person to search for and read foreign-language news sources in the searcher’s own language.** Users can set profiles using simple and complex search queries. I have included several features ensuring users find what they are looking for (ordinarily nearly impossible to accomplish without assistance from a native speaker). I call it One World News.
While developing these unique projects my skillset blossomed:
    1. Relational sql
    2. Headless browser automation
    3. Curl requests (a lesser known, often superior approach to scraping)
    4. Built myself a cookie spoofer to get past Amazon captchas 
    5. Pandas
    6. Seaborn/Joypy (matplotlib), plotting, facegrids, subplots
    7. Countless built-in functions (zip, enumerate, map, etc.)
    8. Experienced the imperative of good coding practices and style
    9. Learned to deal with date-times
    10. The importance of Version Control.
    11. Optimizaton priorities
    12. So much more.

**How you can help:**
-I will always have a lot to learn. If you find the idea of these projects interesting and would like to contribute, Give me a call.
