##### Hi there.

#### Here is some information about me:

My name is Benny.

I program using Python and Sqlite, and perform data anaysis primarily using Pandas and Seaborn. Additionally, I have directly managed website content using HTML and CSS.

My primary interest was initially in machine learning. As time progressed, I began to realise that Machine learning is just one of the many methodologies for interpereting information. 

I am working on two projects of my own invention.

The first project is a tool for visualizing the Israeli rental market. Existing data and charts are...vague and sad. I want the public to be able to understand the layout of the rental market for any area or areas by any metric they so desire.
I gained a laundry list of skills while working on this project...

1) Realtional sql
2) Headless browser automation
3) Curl requests (a lesser known, often superior approach to scraping.)
4) Built myself a cookie spoofer to get past Amazon captchas (almost gave up right here.)
5) Pandas
6) Seaborn/Joypy (matplotlib), plotting, facegrids, subplots
7) Countless bultin functions (zip, enumerate, map, et al)
8) A lot about good coding practices and style
9) Datetime
10) Version control.
11) so much more.


The second project allows any person to search for and read foreign news natively in their own language. Users can set profiles using simple and complex search queries. I have included several features ensuring users always find what they are looking for (ordinarily nearly impossible to accomplish without assistance from a foreigner). I call it One World News.

I am comforatable programming in both Linux and windows environments. Windows OS abruptly died of old age, but I always keep a backup. An important trait when working with databases. It was a good exceuse to switch over.

I'm always welcome to feedback. I value poeples' input. 


##### How you can help:

-I have a lot to learn, and I guarantee my code has noob moments. If you are reading my code (which isn't public at the moment, so I gues not) and know a better implementation, let me know. I'd appreciate the help because you don't know what you don't know. 


I am also on this other site:

#### and I am also one-hundred percent hirable. So hire me ya mofos!

Zero five two - seven five four - four eight three zero.

peace
