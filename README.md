##### Hi there.

### Here is some information about me:

Benjamin Elon from Atlanta, Georgia. Permanently residing in Israel, since 2011.

I needed become a programmer to make money.

Then, I found my passion and decided to pursue more meaningful things.

Now, I use programming to build useful tools, moving towards new knowledge and understanding, advancing projects of interest.

### Language Skills <br>
**Python** and **Sqlite** for web scraping, machine learning, data management<br>
**Pandas** and **Seaborn** for data analysis<br>
**HTML** and **CSS** for managing website content

**Here are several projects of my own creation:**

[ API's are out of date ]<br>
**The first project is a world-wide news tracker. It streamlines the process searching for and reading foreign-language news sources.** Users are able to create personalized news feeds using simple and complex search queries. It includes several features ensuring users can easily find what they are looking for, even without knowing the phrasing in the foreign language. These language barriers are ordinarily very difficult to overcome to overcome without assistance from a native speaker.


[ Website structure is out of date ]<br>
**The second project is an anlyitical tool for intuitively visualizing and comprehending the Israeli rental market.** Openly available information on the Israeli rental market is at best, vague - usually nonexistent. Power tools for apartment seekers are acutally non-existent. Apartment seekers are forced to make subjective decisions about price and other factors. The project goal is to provide access to a greater understanding of the rental market and to provide a tool that makes finding an apartment in Israel easy and objective. While there are several features to be added, this is a fully featured program. Users are able to generate visuals for any combination of regions, citys, and roads for any of the country, using more than 30 normal and composite parameters. Upcoming versions will include geoplotting as well. 

**Other Features:** <br>
-Display data as Histograms, RidgePlots, Linear Regression Plots, or Scatter plots<br>
-Automatic, statistical listings filters (duplicates, pricing errors, etc)<br>
-30 standard parameters ( price, vaad bayit, sqmt, etc. )<br>
-Countless composite parameters ( price/sqmt, days_on_market/price, etc. )<br>
-Custom Listing filters ( for search feed and market analysis )<br>
-Custom Search profiles<br>
-Semi Automated apartment listings scraper<br>

**Here are a few basic examples:** <br>

**The third and newest project is a novel type of monolithic dome construction methodology.** <br>
-This repository contains a wide range of scripts to assist in calculating and compreheding various deisgn aspects of this project.

**Skills gained while developing these unique projects:** <br>
    1. Relational SQL. <br>
    2. Headless browser automation.<br>
    3. Curl requests. <br>
    4. Systems diagramming <br>
    4. Built myself a cookie spoofer to get past Amazon captchas. <br>
    5. Pandas and data manipulation.<br>
    6. Seaborn/Joypy, plotting, facegrids, subplots. <br>
    7. Countless built-in functions ( zip, enumerate, map, etc. ). <br>
    8. Date-times. <br>
    9. Optimizaton priorities. <br>
    10. The importance of good coding practices and style. <br>
    11. The importance of Version Control. <br>
    12. The importance of backups. <br>
    13. And much more.
