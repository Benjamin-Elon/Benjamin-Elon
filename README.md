##### Hi there.

#### Here is some information about me:

My name is Benny.

I program using Python and Sqlite, and perform data anaysis primarily using Pandas and Seaborn. Additionally, I have directly managed website content using HTML and CSS.

My primary interest wa originally in machine learning. As time progressed, I began to realise that I love learning. Machine learning is just one of the many techniques for acessing knowledge. I quickly found that I learn best while on my own path.

I am working on two projects of my own invention.

The first project is a powerful program for Israeli rental analysis. 
I gained an absurd laundry list of skills while working on this project... 

1) Realtional sql (very comfortable)
2) Basic requests library
3) Headless browser (mastery)
4) curl scraping (the best - for real. Uses secret website APIs)
5) Built myself a cookie spoofer to get past Amazon captchas (almost gave up right here.)
6) pandas (msomewhat proficient)
7) Seaborn (matplotlib), plotting, facegrids, subplots
8) Countless bultin functions (zip, enumerate, map, et al)
9) A lot about good coding practices and style
10) Datetime (worked dates a lot)
11) so much more.


The other project allows anyone to read foreign news natively in their own language (and much more). This one is cool... I call it One World News.
The dream for this project is to always get the results they are looking for, in a way no Search engine currently does.


I'm always welcome to feedback. I value poeples' input. 


##### How you can help:

-I have a lot to learn, and I guarantee my code has noob moments. If you are reading my code (which isn't public, so I gues not) and know a better way to implement something, leave a comment with an explanation of what to change. I'd appreciate it because you don't know what you don't know. 


I am also on this other site:
