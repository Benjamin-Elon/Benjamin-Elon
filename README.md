### Hi there.

#### I am one-hundred percent hirable. So hire me ya mofos!

Here is some information about me:

I am learning from 'home'. I try not to actually learn at my home because it's healthy to get out, and I have other places to be. 

I am somewhat proficient programming with Python and Sqlite, and rudementary ability performing data anaysis using R. I have some experience managing website content using HTML and CSS. I can also fiddle with Assembly, but have only done this for the purpose of cheating in MMO's.

My primary interest is in machine learning. I have a newfound love for mathematics, and I find multi-fractal mathematics particularly fascinating. I can't wait to advance my abiities and work on the projects of my dreams. Until that time, I am building tools which are useful in my day-to-day life.

I am working on several projects of my own invention, now using github version control. Lost an entire project. Learned my lesson. And here I am.

I am also on this other useful site:
